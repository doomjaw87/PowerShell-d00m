# PowerShell-d00m
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bygmowboomxrg1e3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/doomjaw87/powershell-d00m)
PowerShell module that doesn't really do much that would be considered directly **helpful**... but is entirely awesome.

## Get-d00mExcuse
User: "Why is the network slow?"

Admin: **Runs Get-d00mExcuse** "Ah yes, because of a 'Total Configuration Destruction'"

User: "Sounds serious..."

Admin: "Yes it is. Partly because of the **Runs Get-d00mExcuse** 'Serial Stack Lockout' you might've caused earlier this week."

Get [BOFH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell)-style excuses all to your (small and miserable) hearts content!

## New-d00mColorFlood
This is entirely **useless**... but so darn pretty. Run it in a PowerShell console on another window and maximize it for __awesomeness__

## Get-d00mSayThings
I wrote this to entertain my kids. Give it a string and the computer will talk to you!

## New-d00mPassword
Generate a password. Parameters to set length and whatnot. This outputs it as a plain old normal string because the PowerShell Gallery got made at me for having ConvertTo-SecureString in there. You can still pipe the function to ConvertTo-SecureString if you desire

## Add-d00mChocolateyPackageSource
This is for adding the Chocolately package source. I wrote this so I wouldn't have to search for the URL and stuff anymore

## New-d00mShortcutCheatSheet
Ah yes, this has some actual production usefulness. Run this and it will create a list of WIN+R (Run) commands and other shortcuts for getting around Windows

## Get-d00mModuleUpdate
Check for updates to your modules, and if specified- update them!

## Set-d00mPowerShellDefaultShell
This is for setting PowerShell as the default shell on a Windows Server Core installation

## ConvertTo-d00mEncryptedString
Do some math and some Base64 encoding to encrypt a string

## ConvertFrom-d00mEncryptedString
Do some math and some Base64 decoding to decrypt a string

## Connect-d00mVm
Connect to a VM either locally or on a remote Hyper-V host

## Enable-d00mRdp
Enable the firewall rules and the registry keys to allow secure RDP connections

## Disable-d00mRdp
Disable the firewall rules and the registry keys to disallow all RDP connections

## Switch-d00mMouseButton
My little son is oddly a lefty in a family of right-handed people. I wrote this to switch the mouse buttons on the fly so he can get his left-hand groove one with the mouse
